There are two files here: import.js and export.js

Simply open up the two editors that you want to copy styles between.

## To export
In the app where you are copying from, copy the code in export.js, paste into devtools and run (or, even better, create a new [devtools snippet](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/snippets/) with it).

## To import
In the app where you are pasting (importing) into, do the same as above but with import.js.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Running import.js will delete all existing styles in the receiving app. 
> Also, default color and font variables will be unaffected by running import.js
